'''You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of 
all the even numbers from 1 to 100. 
Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:
i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100
Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. 
It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.'''

sum = 0
for num in range(1, 101):
    if (num%2 == 0):
        sum += num
print(sum)

'''Otra forma ser√≠a la siguiente: 
sum = 0
for num in range(2, 101, 2):   #que vaya de 2 en 2
        sum += num
print(sum)
